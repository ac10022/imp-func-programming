Write a function sayHi :: IO () that asks for the userâ€™s name with a prompt, reads it from input, and then prints "Hi, <name>!".

Define a function doubleEcho :: IO () that reads a single line from the user and prints it twice on separate lines.

Write a function pureReverse :: String -> String that reverses a string without any IO, and then define ioReverse :: IO () that uses pureReverse to reverse user input and print it.

Create a function askAge :: IO () that prompts the user for their age, reads it, converts it to an Int, and prints "Next year you will be <age + 1>".

Write a function countArgs :: IO () that reads command-line arguments and prints how many were given.

Define a function wordCount :: FilePath -> IO () that reads a .txt file, counts how many words it contains, and prints the total.

Write a function copyTxt :: FilePath -> FilePath -> IO () that copies the contents of one .txt file into another, safely (read fully before writing to avoid lazy IO traps).
